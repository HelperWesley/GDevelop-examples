# Boxy Box Pusher

Boxy Box Pusher, or BBP for short, is a Sokoban example for GDevelop. It includes some simple systems like player movement and box pushing, you however can only move one box at a time and can't push a box with another box.

## Usage

Make sure that each level has at least one hole, only one player hitbox and only one camera point.

You need to have one hole because it would make the game freeze as it would be changing the scene each frame, you need to have one player hitbox as it is what you play the game with and you need one camera point as having none or more will make the camera go to (0, 0) or the origin point/top left corner.

You can change the camera system to your needs.

The levels included are the first five levels of the Boxxle 1 collection of Sokoban games, recreated within Gdevelop

You can replace the animations and images included to whatever you have the rights to, plagiarism is bad.
